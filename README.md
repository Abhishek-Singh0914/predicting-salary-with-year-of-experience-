# predicting-salary-with-year-of-experience-

we will use linear regression model to build this ml project 
 As we know that salary increase with year of experince so it is linearly dependent so will use logistic regression model
 step -1 set learning rate and number of iteration , intiate random weight and bais value
 step -2: build linear regression equation (y=mx+b)
 step -3: find the "y predicted value" for given x value for coressponding weight and bias
 step-4: check the loss function for these parameters vlaues (difeerence between "y pred" and true y)
 step'5- update the paramter values using gradient descent (new weight and bias value)
 step-6: step 3 , 4 , 5 are repaeted till we get minimum loss function 
 finally we will get the best model (best weight and best bias valu ) as it has minimun loss function
